! Common javascript rules
! http://adguard.com/filterrules.html#javascriptInjection
!
! Javascript rules which are not restricted to specific domains.
! Be VERY cautious with this type of rules.
!
!
! YouTube ads (for old and new ads)
! youtube.com - white screen with skip button

! I am not sure why we need this, commented out
! !#if (!adguard_app_ios && !adguard_ext_android_cb)
! @@||youtube.com/get_video_info
! !#endif

! YT fix using json-prune, prune only 1 level
! Commented out - not needed anymore
! youtube.com#%#//scriptlet("json-prune", "adPlacements playerAds")

! These two rules seem to be working okay.
! Commented out for now in order to test the smart override function
! ||youtube.com/*/base.js$replace=/(playerResponse\.adPlacements|playerResponse\.playerAds)/_ad/
! ||youtube.com/*/base.js$replace=/(playerAds|adPlacement[a-zA-Z]+)/_da/
